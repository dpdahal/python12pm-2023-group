# what is operators?
# operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# python divides the operators in the following groups:
# arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
# comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# logical operators: and, or, not
# identity operators: is, is not
# membership operators: in, not in
# bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

# arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# + addition
# - subtraction
# * multiplication
# / division
# % modulus
# ** exponentiation
# // floor division
# print(10 % 2)
# print(4**2)
# print(19 // 5)

# a = 5
# a += 60
# print(a)

# a = 5
# b = 10
# c = a
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))
# print(id(c))
# print(a is b)
# print(a is c)
# print(a is not b)

# name = 'sophia'
# print('s' in name)
# print('z' in name)
# print('z' not in name)
# print('s' not in name)

# print(5 & 6)
# print(bin(5))
# print(bin(6))
# # 100
# print(bin(4))
